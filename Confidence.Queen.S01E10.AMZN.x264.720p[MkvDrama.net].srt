00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:41,250
WEEKLY CINEMA

2
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,044
THE GODDESS OF THE MAINLAND
ACTOR MARY YOO

3
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,087
Mary Yoo?

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,173
I've never heard of that name before.

5
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,176
"Mary Yoo is
not that well-known in Korea."

6
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,386
"Influenced by her father
of Hong Kong nationality,

7
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,264
she first debuted in China
and became a Chinese goddess."

8
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,226
"She's currently looking for her first…"

9
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,607
"She's looking for her first movie?"

10
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,782
Oh, it's him.

11
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:13,783
It's him.

12
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,536
Yes, Mr. Ha.

13
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,374
Director Kim,
have you decided on the female lead yet?

14
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,501
Not yet.

15
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,419
I'm busy because of that right now.

16
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,464
Really? Then for the female lead--

17
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,799
Sorry, I'll call you back.

18
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,008
Hello?

19
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,885
Hello?

20
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,475
Director Kim!

21
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,518
EPISODE 10

22
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,727
-Director Kim!
-Mr. Ha.

23
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,733
She's not well-known in Korea yet,

24
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,694
but she's already a goddess in China.

25
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,988
I was thinking
maybe she could play the lead role?

26
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,325
Oh, man.

27
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,494
What?

28
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,120
My goodness, Mr. Ha.

29
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,332
Are you kidding me?

30
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,792
What?

31
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,254
We have so much in common.

32
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,883
We actually got in touch with Mary Yoo,
so we were arranging the schedule.

33
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:13,926
Really?

34
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,970
Wow, that's great!

35
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,348
I'm touched that
you're so happy like it's your own deal

36
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,476
and that you're worried
about it like it's your own deal.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,853
It couldn't be more touching.

38
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,232
This is no big deal.
You know we're more than that.

39
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,153
-About Mary Yoo.
-Yes.

40
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,530
She has a natural-born talent.

41
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,824
She's a third-generation Korean,
so she's fluent in Korean.

42
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,659
She's also fluent in English.

43
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,161
It's only a matter of time
until she makes it to Hollywood.

44
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,998
However, one thing that bothers me

45
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,543
is that every time she stars in a work,
she gets involved in a scandal.

46
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,420
Oh, with the male lead?

47
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,258
With the investor who invested the most.

48
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,269
But it's up to the investor to be careful.

49
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,770
Of course.

50
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,482
Shall we get going?

51
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,776
Where are we going?

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,736
To meet Mary Yoo.

53
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,654
Mary Yoo?

54
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,614
-Of course.
-Now?

55
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
She's coming on a night flight,
so we have to go now.

56
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,117
Let's go.

57
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,370
Okay.

58
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,682
Aren't these flowers for me?

59
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,644
With the investor who invested the most.

60
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,482
Oh, yes.

61
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,991
Thank you.

62
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,299
Give us a call.

63
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,759
We'll be waiting for good news.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,094
Sure.

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,805
Looking forward to working with you.

66
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,725
Sure.

67
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,595
MADAM GANGSTER

68
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,723
CEO HA JUNG-HO

69
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,350
It's him.

70
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,395
Yes, Mr. Ha.

71
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,272
The investment…

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
I will do it.

73
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,906
He'll invest in us.

74
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,241
Quiet!

75
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,704
Tell him I'm available tonight.

76
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,414
Hey.

77
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,710
But under one condition.

78
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,505
What?

79
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,090
What?

80
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,425
What?

81
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,054
Can we meet now?

82
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,267
James is back. James!

83
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,185
He's back.

84
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,938
-James, how did it go?
-What did he say?

85
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,272
What are his conditions?

86
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,275
Did he ask you
to set up a meeting with me?

87
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,610
Just tell him okay. I'll do it.

88
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,611
I doubt it.

89
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,946
He's not like that.

90
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,073
-What?
-What do you mean?

91
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,660
He's unnecessarily serious about movies.

92
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,453
He told me to change the whole script.

93
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,413
-What?
-What?

94
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,666
He gave us 167 revisions to make!

95
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,583
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

96
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,131
If there are 167 revisions,
that means we have to rewrite it.

97
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,215
Seriously.

98
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,219
"Change the title."

99
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,513
"Produced by Haha Jungho
Fisheries Distribution."

100
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,931
It's so lame.

101
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,975
"Check for action details."

102
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,268
"Reexamine the time period."

103
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,353
"Lack of probability
in the lead character's behavior

104
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,897
-and too many clichés."
-Stop!

105
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,527
We don't have time to fix everything.

106
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,778
Okay?

107
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,407
How about we tell him
we're changing the scenario to buy time

108
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,908
and take off when we get the money?

109
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:30,826
Never.

110
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,786
-Why not?
-Why not?

111
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,291
He'll postpone the investment
until he approves the script himself.

112
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,338
Ha Jung-ho's really serious about movies.

113
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,508
Gosh, he should've been serious
about not ripping off the consumers.

114
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,594
Where do we start?

115
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,429
First, the title…

116
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,892
No matter how much we change it,

117
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,519
we'll never get the script
Ha Jung-ho approves.

118
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:01,190
He'll postpone the investment
until he sees the script he approves.

119
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,316
What do we do about that?

120
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,984
Hey.

121
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,572
A baby who just took his first step
into the film industry is excited.

122
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,407
We should play along.

123
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,201
What?

124
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,954
Give him a chance to play
the buk and janggu?

125
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,331
That's right.

126
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,589
Can't you hear that rhythm?

127
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,258
You don't hear
this traditional Korean rhythm?

128
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,384
Do you hear it?

129
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,385
What are you two doing?

130
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,345
What's wrong with you?

131
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,608
Ha Jung-ho's car set off.

132
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,776
I'll tail him.

133
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,694
HAHA JUNGHO

134
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,990
Ha Jung-ho's going to his office.

135
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,535
Ha Jung-ho's moving.

136
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,829
Ha Jung-ho's back.

137
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,624
Ha Jung-ho's leaving.

138
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,045
Ha Jung-ho's going in.

139
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,341
Ha Jung-ho just got home.

140
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,017
MADAM GANGSTER
CONFIDENTIAL

141
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,546
Oh, hello.

142
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,755
It's us, Mr. Ha.

143
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,843
Hey there!

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,636
-Welcome.
-Hello.

145
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,015
Mr. Ha, thank you
for letting us work here.

146
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,185
Because our job is highly confidential,
we had to ask you a favor.

147
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,896
I hope we're not causing you any trouble
by visiting you unexpectedly.

148
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,189
Oh, come on.

149
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,817
What do you mean, trouble?

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,237
This was my proposal,
so I should take responsibility for it.

151
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,281
-Follow me.
-You have a nice place.

152
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,866
Thanks, come in.

153
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,663
Billy Wilder,
one of the greatest minds in film history,

154
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:26,001
said that 80 percent of a movie
is determined by the script.

155
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:32,174
The outcome of the movie
rests in our hands.

156
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,927
I wasn't aware
of such a good quote by Mr. Wilder.

157
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,013
Scripts are important. Of course!

158
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,809
Mr. Ha, if only our movie
could get better,

159
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,605
I'm more than happy to do this
as a director.

160
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,734
I knew all film lovers
had so much in common.

161
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,027
Of course.

162
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,280
-Mr. Ha, I love it, too.
-Oh, yes.

163
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,449
All right. Shall we get started?

164
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,581
-Is that Mary Yoo?
-What?

165
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,626
Are you saying that's the storyboard?

166
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,128
That?

167
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,883
Mary Yoo dashes out of the boutique.

168
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,761
Mary Yoo runs out!

169
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,514
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

170
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,474
Madame Oh's Heydays.

171
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,394
Isn't that the perfect title?

172
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,397
I've worked so hard on this script,
and now everything has to be his way.

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,065
That's just like Yeong-ja's Heydays.

174
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:35,487
Bravo! The title is fantastic,
elegant, and sensational.

175
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,905
That's impressive!

176
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,077
Director Kim, do you not like it?

177
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,662
-No, that's freaking… I mean…
-What?

178
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,455
That's fabulous.

179
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,957
It's amazing.

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,752
All right. Then, allow me
to explain it to you.

181
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,256
Here, this is the scene
I consider most important.

182
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,632
Oh, that's important.

183
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,634
It's the scene in front of Daehan Cinema.

184
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,722
It's where Mary Yoo fights
about 20 gangsters.

185
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,517
This is very important.

186
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,394
I'm sorry to interrupt
something so important,

187
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,646
but something important came up.

188
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,232
-I have to use the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom.

189
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,733
It's that way.

190
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,279
Director Kim. Let me continue.

191
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,644
Not here.

192
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,108
Anything in the basement?

193
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,819
A home theater, a golf simulator,
and a parking garage. That's all.

194
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,404
There's no place to hide a painting.

195
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,031
There was nothing upstairs.

196
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,741
Should we sound out Ha Jung-ho more?

197
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,075
Should we? I'll do that.

198
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,663
"Men pass out
every time Madame Oh passes."

199
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,040
"While she's fighting,

200
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,461
the hostages dash out
of the bars and run to the exit."

201
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,343
That's impressive.

202
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,595
Your imagination for a film
is outstanding.

203
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,060
Well, speaking of imagination,

204
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,937
when you watch a movie,

205
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,023
every rich family has a secret room
in their houses, you know?

206
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:39,194
For example, like a shelter
in case of an earthquake.

207
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,947
Do you have a space like that
in your house, too?

208
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,118
A shelter?

209
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,328
Yes.

210
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,704
-A basement?
-Yes.

211
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,249
A shelter?

212
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,460
I regret not making one.

213
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,464
It's not like
this country is safe from earthquakes, so…

214
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,591
Darn it. He doesn't have one.

215
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,303
Because you make movies,

216
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,389
you're very imaginative.

217
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:08,890
Right.

218
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,852
Because I was being
cinematically imaginative,

219
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,980
I overstepped the boundaries.
I went too far.

220
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,232
Don't worry. Let's continue.

221
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,277
"Without missing him, she throws him down

222
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,237
and puts a knife against his neck…"

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,407
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

224
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,208
Maybe he sold it already.

225
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,003
No, I haven't heard
that it was on the market.

226
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,922
There was nothing unusual
in Ha Jung-ho's movement.

227
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,758
For goodness' sake,
where did he put that painting?

228
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,427
A painting!

229
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,389
Does Ha Jung-ho, that punk,
even want to have the props as he pleases?

230
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,851
I bet he'll make a fuss
about directing, too.

231
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,644
It's obvious.

232
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,231
How dare he try to mess with props?

233
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,566
Are you sleeping?

234
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,739
I didn't know Gu-ho had the skills
to communicate while sleeping.

235
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,490
But you heard it, right?

236
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,577
Props.

237
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,332
Sometimes, Gu-ho has a genius moment.

238
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,541
Although it's very rare.

239
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,667
You're right.

240
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,877
Sleep tight.

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,337
You piece of shit...

242
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,009
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

243
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,218
Okay. Are you ready?

244
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:28,970
Here we go.

245
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,765
All right. One, two, three.

246
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,441
Have some tea.

247
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,404
Nice.

248
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,407
We're going to have a meal at Renaissance,

249
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,701
have coffee, and go to the movies.

250
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,954
Madame Oh, would you like to join us?

251
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,749
I would absolutely love to,

252
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,252
but to complete your dresses
before the dinner with the officials,

253
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,505
I won't have enough time,
even if I stay up all night.

254
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,924
I feel so bad for you.

255
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,176
Take me with you next time.

256
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,511
Of course.

257
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,347
Right. What do you want to watch, ma'am?

258
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,518
I hear Be Strong, Ji-hyeong
is popular lately.

259
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,312
Oh, my. I love it.

260
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,108
Speaking of which, where is that playing?

261
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,860
At Daehan Cinema. Why do you ask?

262
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,195
Are you coming?

263
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,531
It's not a good idea to go there tonight.

264
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,699
-Why is that?
-Why not?

265
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,950
Why? What's wrong?

266
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:36,913
I heard the West Gate Gang
is watching a movie there tonight.

267
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,292
My goodness.
That could've been a disaster!

268
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,003
We could have gotten killed
while watching a movie.

269
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,296
Jeez, that's scary.

270
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,272
-Yes!
-Fantastic!

271
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,691
That was perfect, Mary Yoo!

272
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,694
-Nice. Good job.
-Wow.

273
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,904
Mary! I loved the look in your eyes!

274
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,282
-It was fantastic.
-Thank you.

275
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,241
By the way, who is he?

276
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,452
He's Mr. Ha Jung-ho
of Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution.

277
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,369
Hello.

278
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,328
Director Kim.

279
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,455
Mary Yoo, that was amazing.

280
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,957
But the sunlight was too strong just now.

281
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,625
I think I blinked a little.

282
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,628
-How do we film the Daehan Cinema scene?
-Is that okay?

283
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,005
I know that.

284
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,175
Your blink was more appropriate
for Madame Oh's character development.

285
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,218
-The next scene…
-I blinked for about 2.5 seconds.

286
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,428
No.

287
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,431
Mary, your eyes are the highlight.
You have such beautiful eyes.

288
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,392
Everyone knows her eyes are beautiful.
Back up.

289
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,227
-But there's a slight…
-I fell in love with…

290
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,645
-Back up.
-They're beautiful.

291
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,105
-Back up.
-They're amazing.

292
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,565
-Back up.
-It's so noisy.

293
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,275
-She says you're noisy.
-It's so noisy.

294
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,943
Director, are you ready?

295
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:49,861
Okay.

296
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,697
Director, are you ready?

297
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,365
-Yes, all good.
-Okay.

298
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,534
Director Kim, everything is ready.

299
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,995
-Be quiet, jeez.
-Sorry.

300
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,246
I made them quiet.

301
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,790
Be nice, jeez.

302
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,166
Okay. I'll keep cool.

303
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,128
Here we go.

304
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,547
One, two, three.

305
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,511
Hey!

306
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,929
Don't cross.

307
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:16,846
Don't get any closer.

308
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,266
Hey, stop.

309
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,643
What brings you here?

310
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,605
I'm here to watch a movie.

311
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,106
Is there a problem?

312
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,901
We have a group watching.

313
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,070
Not today, pretty lady.

314
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:37,617
Oh, do thugs watch movies these days?

315
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,745
What in the…

316
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,746
Hey, lady.

317
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,875
You could be nice
and call us "gangsters," but thugs?

318
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,462
Get the hell out of my sight now.
I don't go easy on women.

319
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,256
Hear me? Get lost.

320
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,634
Hey…

321
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,556
I don't go easy on men, either.

322
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,724
Guys, come on!

323
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:11,860
Come at me.

324
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,578
Cut now?

325
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,537
No.

326
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,920
Camera!

327
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,839
Get close to her!

328
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,300
Cameraman. Get closer. Film her closely.

329
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,218
What the heck are you doing?

330
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,678
I said, get in there now!

331
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,972
Camera, come on. Get closer!

332
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,057
This is the highlight of the movie!

333
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,517
Are you going to waste it like that?

334
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,602
Hey, fire him.

335
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,853
You go in! Now!

336
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,770
But…

337
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,398
Gosh, seriously.

338
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:53,860
Hey, this way.

339
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,530
-Good.
-That's what I'm talking about.

340
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,823
They should've done that sooner.

341
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,747
Below.

342
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,375
Hurry up and turn. Turn.

343
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,754
The camera work is amazing.

344
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,339
In 360 degrees.

345
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,008
Should I watch it this way or this way?

346
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,094
-That's the end of the century vibe.
-It's 360 degrees.

347
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,763
-Wow, awesome.
-This is just wow.

348
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:41,240
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.

349
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,245
The storage in the mountains
of Bokgang-ri…

350
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,849
Get out of here quickly.

351
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,602
Can we go home now?

352
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,772
Yes, you're free now.

353
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,148
Really?

354
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,942
-We're safe now.
-Hurry up.

355
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,361
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

356
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,459
What a beautiful world this is!

357
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,254
Good work.

358
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,006
You could be a director yourself.

359
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,049
That was the best scene, right?

360
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,218
-You could be a director.
-Let's continue after the meal.

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,136
Be quiet!

362
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,139
We just got the perfect scene.

363
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,435
-Fire that guy.
-What…

364
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,312
-How dare you interrupt Mr. Ha?
-Don't stop me.

365
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,106
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

366
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,028
Hey, Mary Yoo.

367
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,239
Were you looking at the script?

368
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,534
This is our biggest investor…

369
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,663
No, the biggest investor-to-be,
no, you can basically say he is the one.

370
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,416
This is our future investor,
Mr. Ha Jung-ho.

371
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,626
Oh, really?

372
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,378
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

373
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,796
Gosh, isn't her acting great?

374
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,925
I just loved the look in her eyes.

375
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,055
Thank you.

376
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,643
HAHA JUNGHO

377
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,606
I just sent you the investment.

378
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,566
Already?

379
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,484
Yes.

380
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,820
DEPOSITED 4,000,000,000 WON

381
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,156
My goodness. Thank you.

382
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:52,830
Director Kim.

383
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,250
-Yes.
-About the highlight.

384
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,335
Which highlight?

385
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:03,049
Oh, you mean the scene
where you meet the thug boss at the end?

386
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,802
Oh, how do you know
the scenario that well?

387
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,764
It's only the basics as an investor.

388
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,016
I knew it.

389
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,938
I was thinking
maybe we should have a symbolic painting

390
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:22,777
to reflect the boss's psychology
in that scene.

391
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,862
A mere thug wouldn't care
so much about a painting…

392
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,159
Well…

393
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,996
Like the night of a full moon?

394
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,916
A full moon night?

395
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:42,588
Either dark shadows
approaching a sacred castle,

396
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:47,760
or praying or something?

397
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
What?

398
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,597
Full moon.

399
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,099
The dark shadows.

400
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,810
A sacred castle.

401
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,938
A painting with all that…

402
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,111
There is one.

403
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,696
A perfect match for that.

404
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,281
Really?

405
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,740
Oh, my. Really?

406
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:14,620
Yes, I have just the perfect painting
with that image, Mary Yoo!

407
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,417
That's great news!

408
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,712
Oh, then can you sponsor it?

409
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,589
Totally, Mary.

410
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,634
That's awesome.

411
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,095
But…

412
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,765
under one condition.

413
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,185
One condition. Of course.

414
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,022
The time has come.

415
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:46,694
Oh, what kind of condition is that?

416
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,078
I will…

417
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,082
play the thug boss.

418
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,382
Yes, totally!

419
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,054
You'll be perfect for it!

420
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,556
What do you say? Isn't he perfect?
What do you say?

421
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,474
Director Kim?

422
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,100
-Sure.
-Deal!

423
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,394
Mary?

424
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,604
Please, Mary.

425
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,898
Deal!

426
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,370
We've found the painting.

427
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,663
Finally.

428
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,206
Where was it?

429
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,627
At his second ex-wife's office.

430
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,588
Oh, I didn't think that far.

431
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:48,673
I know, right?

432
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,802
"You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own."

433
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,222
Mr. Ha, you look wonderful.

434
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,057
Should I call you Boss?

435
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,893
-How are you?
-Oh, you look wonderful.

436
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,020
It looks more perfect with the painting.

437
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,689
-You think so?
-Thank you.

438
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,440
You're welcome.
Let me get back to practice.

439
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,650
For sure.

440
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:13,155
"You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own."

441
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,073
On your own.

442
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,533
Ready.

443
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,593
Found you.

444
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,527
I've been waiting for you, Madame Oh.

445
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,739
Jung-ho?

446
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,075
Jung-ho, what are you doing here?

447
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,579
You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own.

448
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,582
Why did you have to make a fuss
about taking revenge

449
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,626
when you couldn't even do it?

450
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,588
Then, the body that was found
along with my dad's in the factory fire,

451
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,881
that wasn't you?

452
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,718
Of course not.

453
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,345
-I'm standing right here!
-Oh, my.

454
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,013
Alive!

455
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,182
I devoted my whole life

456
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,061
to killing the boss of the West Gate Gang
that set the factory on fire.

457
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,938
Why are you doing this to me?

458
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,734
Even if I tell you the truth now,
what difference is that going to make?

459
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,945
Just stick to being who you are

460
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,489
and carry on, will you?

461
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,492
I can let go of what you did to me,

462
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,953
but why did you have to be
so cruel to my dad,

463
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,871
when he treated you like his own son?

464
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:30,459
Money!

465
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,545
What else could it be aside from money?

466
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,838
Money can get me everything.

467
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,175
For money, people are willing
to go to prison for me.

468
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,346
Do you know
how many politicians I've bribed?

469
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,890
You think they'd just sit on their hands?

470
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,769
You think I'd die that easily?

471
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,817
I can't believe
I loved such a crazy moron.

472
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,201
Stop going on about how you loved me.

473
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,787
I'm sick of even making excuses.

474
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,831
Now…

475
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:16,380
Goodbye, Madame Oh!

476
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,898
Don't shoot!

477
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,649
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:40,863
I was blinded by money…

479
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:53,918
Can you really shoot me?

480
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,518
-Boss!
-Boss!

481
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,560
What happened?

482
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,978
Big Boss!

483
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,396
Boss!

484
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,077
Cut! Okay! The end of the shoot.

485
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,080
Good work.

486
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,415
Your acting was amazing!

487
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,670
-Good work.
-Gosh, I loved your eyes.

488
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,631
Oh, Mary Yoo. Great job.

489
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,633
-I loved it.
-Thank you.

490
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,803
-This is for you, Mr. Ha.
-What? Me too?

491
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,055
You're guaranteed to win
the Male Rookie Award.

492
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,724
Oh, stop it. You're flattering me.

493
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:53,852
Let's give it up
for Mr. Ha for his hard work!

494
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,356
That's all for the last shoot.

495
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,525
We'll see you shortly at the after-party!
Good work!

496
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,734
Good work.

497
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,320
I'll send you the date
for the press conference later.

498
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,489
-Good job.
-Good work.

499
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,991
-Thank you.
-Thanks for your work.

500
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,826
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

501
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,661
Mr. Ha.

502
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,996
Thank you for your work.

503
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,925
Why put on so much makeup
in the middle of the night?

504
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,677
The shoot's over. We should drink to that.

505
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,054
Ha Jung-ho wouldn't miss
his chance tonight.

506
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:32,433
Why do you have to bring up that name?
He appalls me.

507
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,270
Why do you think he was
so passionate about this project?

508
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,064
Probably because
of his unaccomplished dream about cinema.

509
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,065
Come on.

510
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:45,195
It was to have Mary Yoo,
the beautiful woman from heaven.

511
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,283
Don't tell me you haven't noticed
all that effort Ha Jung-ho made.

512
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,578
Yes.

513
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,002
If he asks me out for a drink,
I'll have just one drink.

514
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,253
Never.

515
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,171
Why not?

516
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,924
He invested four billion won.

517
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,135
I could get a dress
for the press conference tomorrow.

518
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,178
Then I'll come with you.

519
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,681
How can I let you go alone with that perv?

520
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,724
I'll never allow it.

521
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,267
It's going to be a hotel bar.

522
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,144
Hotel bar or whatever, I said no.

523
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,939
Wait. He's here.

524
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,358
-Is he really here?
-Go.

525
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,276
Me?

526
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,738
-Good evening.
-Mr. Ha.

527
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,281
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

528
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,259
I got you something to go
with your dress, Mary Yoo.

529
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,220
Oh, my.

530
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,388
What is all this?

531
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,017
Oh, this is beautiful.

532
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,813
Darn that wealthy snob.

533
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,022
Then?

534
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,400
Shall we go out for a drink?

535
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,820
What's with that attitude?

536
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,074
Well, give me a moment.

537
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,328
Seeing this necklace,
I have the perfect dress to go with it.

538
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,247
Let me get changed.

539
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:24,211
No, you must be tired from shooting.

540
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,008
Director Kim.

541
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,845
Yes?

542
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,391
Do you want to go out for a drink?

543
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,229
What? With me?

544
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,605
-With him?
-Why?

545
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,816
From the first moment I saw you,

546
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,528
I knew you were a good person.

547
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,614
My first impression is never wrong.

548
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,992
I think it is wrong.

549
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,550
Director Kim. That's great!

550
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:25,272
I knew all film lovers
had so much in common.

551
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,775
Of course, Mr. Ha.

552
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,778
All right. Action!

553
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,411
The energy you poured
into the film was extraordinary.

554
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,914
It wasn't that extraordinary.

555
00:34:55,928 --> 00:35:00,098
Perhaps we could be fantastic partners.

556
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,563
What do you mean by partners?

557
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:14,613
I plan to invest more in cinema.

558
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,407
Wow. That's a great idea, sure.

559
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,786
If you get to know me,
there's nothing to lose.

560
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,538
I already lost…

561
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,373
Wait. That's right.

562
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,500
Mr. Ha, I have to edit…

563
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,045
It won't take long, Director Kim.

564
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,382
Director Ha… I mean, Mr. Ha!

565
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,509
I'll treat you big time later.

566
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,468
Mary Yoo. Goodnight.

567
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:38,053
-Sure.
-Director Kim.

568
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,138
-Director Kim.
-No.

569
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,141
For goodness' sake.

570
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,728
Director Kim!

571
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,939
Director Kim.

572
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,108
Director Kim.

573
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,818
Can we have just one drink?

574
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,194
Just one.

575
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,237
Come here.

576
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,780
I just have something to say.

577
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,991
-No, I can't…
-Come here.

578
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,325
This way, please.

579
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,618
Come this way.

580
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,078
Hey, not that way.

581
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,293
Wow, is that why he got divorced twice?

582
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,629
No, my Gu-ho. I have to protect him.

583
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:13,839
My Gu-ho.

584
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,007
Gu-ho!

585
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,842
Don't let him catch you.

586
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,176
Never!

587
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,805
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS
VIP PRESS CONFERENCE

588
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,393
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

589
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,109
Can you look to the right?

590
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,779
Look to the left, please.

591
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,700
Oh, hello.

592
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,036
Yes.

593
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,078
Look who it is!

594
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,872
-Mr. Ha!
-Congressman Choi!

595
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,875
-Lawyer Park.
-Congratulations.

596
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,668
Thank you so much for coming.

597
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:52,794
Of course, I had to come.

598
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,212
Oh, that's right.

599
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,798
This is the lead actress. Mary Yoo.

600
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,009
Oh, she's gorgeous.

601
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,428
-And this is our director.
-Hello.

602
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,263
And this is the producer.

603
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,389
Good work.

604
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,807
I'll enjoy watching.

605
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,309
-Let's go.
-Okay.

606
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,230
When this movie ends,
a whole new world will begin for you.

607
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,983
You think so?

608
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,736
I'm so nervous.

609
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,654
Let's go.

610
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,620
Stay tuned.

611
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,003
Taffies.

What the?

614
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,572
Where's my face…

615
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:03,949
What is that?

616
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,953
That can be edited again.

617
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:12,207
Gosh, do I have to edit it myself?

618
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,094
I like that angle.

619
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,851
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.

620
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,646
-The storage in the mountains…
-It's starting now.

00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,546
Look what you've done! We can't use this!

626
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,006
Be more careful!

627

what difference is that going to make?

631
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:24,321
Just stick to being who you are
and carry on, will you?

632
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,657
Hello, sir.

633
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,868
How much did we get today?

634
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,536
We got three trucks.

635
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,371
Change the labels before distributing.

636
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:34,623
Get back to work.

637
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,216
Oh, let's drink.

638
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,303
That elementary school
food poisoning incident.

639
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:49,888
Was that your work?

640
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,475
I'm ashamed, Congressman Choi.

641
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,729
Come on. Why so discouraged
over something so trivial?

642
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,773
Just put the blame on your subcontractor.

643
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,775
-Put the blame?
-Yes.

644
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,612
Oh, I could put the blame on them!

645
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,530
That's a good idea!

646
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,408
You're truly amazing! One second.

647
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,745
I've brought something for all of you.

00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,074
Let's never see each other again.

661
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,994
How dare you repay my kindness like this?

662
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,539
No pictures.

663
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,457
WRITTEN, DIRECTED,
STARRED, INVESTED BY HA JUNG-HO

664
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,209
Where are you going?

665
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,961
-No pictures.
-Move.

666
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,731
What the hell is this? I'm doomed!

667
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,276
I want to go back!

668
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,908
Over there. Put it there.

669
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,580
Thank you.

670
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,123
Thank you so much.

671
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,875
You've been through so much.

672
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,378
I felt bad after hearing
what happened to you.

673
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,339
I'm glad I can assist in this way.

674
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:48,715
Oh, right.

675
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,262
We have a gift for you.
This isn't much, but I hope you enjoy it.

676
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,847
Oh, you didn't have to.

677
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,349
Bye now.

678
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,308
Enjoy.

679
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,186
-Come on, let's go!
-Let's go!

680
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,889
-My goodness!
-Sir, are you all right?

681
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,016
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

682
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,645
-What is all this?
-What?

683
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,856
-What is going on?
-How much is all this?

684
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,583
YOUR MOVIE WHERE YOU ARE THE LEAD

685
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:10,547
A WONDERFUL HAPPY ENDING
IS WAITING FOR YOU

686
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,303
I hope Oh Chang-dae's life
has a happy ending.

687

ARCHITECT KANG YO-SEOP
STUDIED IN GERMANY

688
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,971
Fuck.

689
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,231
Son of a bitch.

690
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,403
YU KANG-IL
SPECIAL EXHIBITION: TO EXIST

691
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,089
I've found the painting
that you've wanted.

692
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:39,928
Isn't it about time to stop
playing the charade and show yourself?

693
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,895
The strong colors and bold brushstrokes

694
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,899
in this work by the late Yu Kang-il
are captivating.

695
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:56,694
Please take a moment to appreciate it.

696
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,667
This painting…

697
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,311
Hello, Professor Kang Yo-seop.

698
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,229
Hello.

699
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:36,484
I'm quite interested in this painting.

700
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,278
I see.

701
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,426
Because it's a painting
by late Yu Kang-il,

702
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,678
a lot of people like it.

703
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,057
Thank you.

704
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,278
Kang Yo-seop.

705
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,864
We've finally met.

706
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,953
Everything I've done until now
was just a small game to get near you.

707
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,708
The game we've been playing
isn't over yet.

708
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:39,506
The real game begins now.

709
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:50,266
That was a wonderful lecture
by the CEO of Josef Architects.

710
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:55,396
Lastly, we'll listen to his final comment
before we go.

711
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,192
PLAN UTOPIA
PROFESSOR KANG YO-SEOP'S LECTURE

712
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:06,074
A city is a mirror
that reflects human society.

713
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:08,201
The gap between the rich and the poor,

714
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,621
the desire for power,
and the desire for possession.

715
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,082
They are all naturally woven
into the city.

716
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,086
So I thought, "What if I change the city?"

717
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:21,923
"What if I design a space
where every person can be equally happy?"

718
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,677
Wouldn't that help change our minds
in which we're becoming

719
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,763
more and more personalized,
consumption-oriented,

720
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,974
and exasperatingly competitive?

721
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:36,437
That's why I wrote Plan Utopia.

722
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,566
Any questions?

723
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,781
In this book,

724
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,743
you wrote that your childhood was worse
than simply growing up in a poor family.

725
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:54,289
I wonder how you overcame
that environment.

726
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,793
They say wealthy kids learn
how to open the door,

727
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,005
while poor kids learn
how to jump over the fence.

728
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,011
You have to eat up.

729
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,470
My family was so poor growing up

730
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,599
that we didn't even have a door
or a fence to jump over.

731
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:13,850
Here. Eat up.

732
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:18,229
Your husband is home. Damn it.

733
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:20,023
How dare a woman…

734
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,236
Don't open the door
until I tell you to, okay?

735
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,237
Okay.

736
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,281
You think I'm a joke?

737
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,533
Where are you?

738
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,661
Hey!

739
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:42,587
Hey!

740
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,133
Why was I born
into such an unfortunate family?

741
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,676
I couldn't stand it.

742
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,848
The world gave everyone
a different starting line.

743
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:58,478
Unfortunately,
the world is an unfair place.

744
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,898
If I can't open the door,

745
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,775
if I must work hard
to jump over the fence,

746
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,902
I thought I might as well
destroy the fence.

747
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,489
Well, it wasn't anything amazing.

748
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,075
But I decided to go study in Germany.

749
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,912
Were you on a government scholarship?

750
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,167
I had to work part-time
when other people were studying.

751
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,672
I had to work to survive.

752
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,133
Desperation was my life at the time.

753
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,847
-Me!
-Me!

754
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,891
-Who wants to touch the pigeon?
-Me!

755
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:39,894
Here.

756
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,861
To me, studying abroad
wasn't a simple choice,

757
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:52,365
but the only way
to overcome the unfair world.

758
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,035
So, I decided to play a new game

759
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,538
for myself.

760
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,125
Because my GPA wasn't high enough,

761
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:07,130
I missed the government scholarship,
but I got to tutor a child.

762
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,300
She was a successor
of a major corporation you all know.

763
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:17,724
Too bad.

764
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,892
I won again.

765
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,691
It wasn't easy to teach her

766
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,444
because she was a mischievous girl.

767
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,738
But thanks to her,
I secured the budget to study abroad.

768
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,656
And the child…

769
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,871
got to learn the real world.

770
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,335
If there aren't any more questions,
how about we end the lecture here?

771
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:47,920
Professor?

772
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,467
Professor Kang Yo-seop.

773
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,595
You may speak.

774
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:04,187
I'm curious about your ultimate goal.

775
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,359
That's perfect for the last question.

776
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,487
Just as the title says.

777
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,948
I want to plan
and embody a new type of city

778
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,367
that meets the human instinct.

779
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,371
But who knows?
No one knows if I'd be given that chance.

780
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,210
That's all for my lecture. Thank you.

781
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,308
Chief Kang, I enjoyed reading your book.

782
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,601
-You finished it already?
-Yes.

783
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,103
-I read it five times.
-You're lying.

784
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,188
-I'm not.
-Picture?

785
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:58,407
-I really enjoyed your lecture.
-Thank you.

786
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,620
Just wait.

787
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,622
It's my turn now.

788
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,585
James.

789
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:14,715
When I first arrived in Seoul, I never
thought I'd get to do a job like this.

790
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,759
So? Do you regret it?

791
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,344
No!

792
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,388
I think this is great.

793
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,058
And I'm very thankful to you and Yi-rang.

794
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,103
Thank you, James.

795
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,064
Jeez, don't be cringy. Stop it.

796
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,567
TOTAL -58,590,500

797
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,484
What is that?

798
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:37,446
Negative 58,590,500 won?

799
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:40,074
Gosh, I should've listened
to Mr. Mustache.

800
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,785
Why did I bother getting the red carpet?
It's a loss.

801
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,328
Does Yi-rang know about this?

802
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,288
No, she doesn't.

803
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:50,585
Where on earth did she go
when things are this serious?

804
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,795
James, do you know anything?

805
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,297
What?

806
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,381
Yes.

807
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,383
I mean, no, I don't know.

808
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,308
Is the laundry done?

809
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,189
But you just did the laundry.

810
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,193
There's something between the two.

811
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,782
That reminds me
how this operation was pretty strange.

812
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,492
A full moon night?

813
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:29,123
Either dark shadows
approaching a sacred castle,

814
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:34,295
or praying or something?

815
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,924
I mean, a painting out of nowhere?
That was strange.

816
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:41,093
And the fact that she sent us to
Ha Jung-ho's place just to fix the script.

817
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,816
Late Yu Kang-il's last painting
discovered by a critic 20 years ago

818
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,028
is finally displayed at Dana Art Museum.

819
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:03,282
Artist Yu Kang-il
was evaluated matchless among the artists,

820
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:07,119
but he suddenly ceased performing
and was forgotten by the public.

821
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,897
GIL BEAUTY

822
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,276
LEE SEON-MI

823
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:57,378
MYUNG JIN-SU

824
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,633
Dad…

825
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,685
Yun Yi-rang.

826
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,732
What is all this?

827
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:26,115
Why is everyone we worked on
all connected?

828
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:34,790
And... why is my dad on this?

829
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,336
Tell me.

830
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,798
Why is my dad…

831
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:45,009
Why is he connected to them?

832
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,304
Tell me.

833
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,726
Your father was one of the victims.

834
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,816
Victim?

835
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,320
My dad was?

836
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:08,699
What are you…

837
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,914
My dad died in an accident.

838
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,416
It was an accident.

839
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,419
What do you mean he's a victim?

840
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:22,880
Tell me the truth.

841
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,007
Why is he a victim?

842
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,426
Huh?

843
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,472
Why is his picture up here?

844
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,433
Say something.

845
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:35,434
Come on.

846
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,521
Tell me the truth, Yun Yi-rang!

847
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,314
Why is he a victim?

848
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,766
I thought you were sick
of working with us.

849
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,562
It's kind of tough for me
after Gu-ho left.

850
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,314
Gosh, something doesn't feel right.

851
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:24,817
The true reason Kang Yo-seop hired me.

852
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,362
She'll be more useful than I expected.

853
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,532
So? Do you like it?

854
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,033
I want you to come with me.

855
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,577
You can leave if you want to.

856
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,203
Funny.

857
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:38,581
No.

858
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,875
You got it in the end.
