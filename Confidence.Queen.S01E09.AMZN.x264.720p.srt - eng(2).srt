1
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:50,342
Hide tight, I can see your hair

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:59,226
Hide tight, I can see your hair

3
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:13,574
Hide tight, I can see your hair

4
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:31,550
Hide tight, I can see your hair

5
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,251
Found you.

6
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,596
Were you that curious about me?

7
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,766
Did I appear in your dream again?

8
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,103
Are you still looking for me?

9
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,861
This is exactly what I wanted.

10
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,240
Rich parents and a guaranteed future.

11
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,160
It's only fair if you also get a penalty.

12
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,996
Am I right?

13
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,127
A trauma that will
always remind you of me.

14
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,530
APRIL 2020

15
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,498
EPISODE 9

16
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,721
Say what you need to say.

17
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,688
Are you having trouble sleeping?

18
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,027
Are you having nightmares?

19
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,574
It's my turn now. That's only fair.

20
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,456
I'm going to be his nightmare now.

21
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,972
I think that's him.

22
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,727
Do you have a reservation
with us for today?

23
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,811
Yes, we do.

24
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,104
Hello, nice to meet you.

25
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,128
Will you wait here for a second?

26
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,464
Let me grab the ingredients for dinner.

27
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,218
Are you sure that's him?

28
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,095
Let's just say a glow-down.

29
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,895
So, you're saying the informant
Myung Jin-su could be the culprit?

30
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,229
We'll have to look into it first,

31
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,775
but Myung Jin-su went missing
after he received the reward.

32
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,319
And a year later,
only his skeleton was found.

33
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,821
Do you think he's not dead?

34
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:07,576
Nothing's more perfect than that
in hiding his identity.

35
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,536
If Myung Jin-su is alive…

36
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,623
His son, who is his only family,
would know something?

37
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,250
I got a really huge fish…

38
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,712
I'm okay!

39
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,255
This one… Gosh.

40
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,636
Look at this. Do you want to take a photo?

41
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:31,183
An inn would do all this for us? Terrific!

42
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,853
Actually, you're my last guests.

43
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,690
So I wanted to treat you
to a hearty dinner.

44
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,400
Are you closing this place down?

45
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:46,615
Yes, we're getting fewer tourists.
And I actually got a job in Seoul.

46
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,909
-I see.
-That's actually better.

47
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,619
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

48
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,540
Oh, that smells good.

49
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:55,958
Here.

50
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,877
Oh, that smells good.

51
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,920
Enjoy your meal.

52
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,380
No, wait. Why don't you join us?

53
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,132
No, I'm good.

54
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,008
Come here. This is so much food.

55
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,678
We can't finish it. Come on and join us.

56
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,976
By the way, it seems I'm a lot younger
than you two. Please drop the honorifics.

57
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,102
-Can we?
-Can we?

58
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,103
What's your name?

59
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,772
-My name is Myung Gu-ho.
-Gu-ho?

60
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,982
Okay. Here.

61
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,778
-Gu-ho?
-Yes, Gu-ho.

62
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,493
Oh, you know how to drink.

63
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,537
-Here, one more.
-I can't drink…

64
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,873
-It must've been tough, right?
-Yes.

65
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,957
You must be thirsty.

66
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,461
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

67
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,796
Yes. Cheers.

68
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,428
Do you live here alone?

69
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,138
Yes.

70
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,309
Actually, my grandpa is
in that photo over there.

71
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,853
I used to live with my grandpa.

72
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,480
Then, after he passed away,
I've been living alone.

73
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,481
What about your father?

74
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,777
My father was a matroos.

75
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,281
Oh, was your father a sailor?

76
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,199
Yes.

77
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,201
-One moment.
-Okay.

78
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,536
Where did I put it?

79
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,705
Excuse me for a moment.

80
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,335
Let's search his room first
when he passes out.

81
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,628
Okay.

82
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,005
Stop drinking, by the way,
or you'll get drunk.

83
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,132
James, you stop eating.
Are you here to eat?

84
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,800
I found it!

85
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,055
This is my father.

86
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,974
Oh, you look a lot like your father.

87
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,267
-You think?
-Yes.

88
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,019
My father…

89
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,649
Well, he promised he'd come
to my elementary school entrance ceremony.

90
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,068
And?

91
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,570
He passed away.

92
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,572
Oh, no. What happened?

93
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,867
But before he passed away, I got a call.

94
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,577
What call?

95
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,915
That if I listened to Uncle,

96
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:06,463
if I had a good time with him,
he'd come get me.

97
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,050
Uncle?

98
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,052
From your mom's side or your dad's?

99
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,346
Oh, I can't believe
I'm saying this to you.

100
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,935
Was that jerk, I mean…

101
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:25,482
Was your uncle tall?
Or did he have a husky voice…

102
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,858
You know what?

103
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,528
I went to Seoul
for the first time in my life.

104
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:34,491
I even went to the theme park,
which was really fun.

105
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,077
But what's the point?

106
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,122
My dad wasn't with me.

107
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,378
Am I wrong?

108
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,715
What's the point of all that
without my dad?

109
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,221
Dad promised to come get me.

110
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,186
Jeez.

111
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,941
Oh, jeez.

112
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,577
A special pass ticket from March 28, 2000?

113
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,245
March 28.

114
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,331
That's the day you were kidnapped.

115
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,628
There must be something
we aren't aware of.

116
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,408
Did you find anything?

117
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,326
Nothing.

118
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,456
What's that?

119
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,625
Is that an annex?

120
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,314
CONDOLENCES
SEONGJIN POLICE STATION

121
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,066
I found it.

122
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,491
DRIVER'S LICENSE

123
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,785
-It belongs to Myung Jin-su.
-We found it.

124
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,747
There must be something in here.

125
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,085
GU-HO'S INN

126
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,880
The recent calls are all Seoul
or Gyeonggi Province numbers.

127
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,425
That uncle guy.

128
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,678
Whenever he called Myung Jin-su,
he always used the pay phone.

129
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,139
He hid his identity completely.

130
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,407
There's a photo.

131
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,625
How long have you been here for?

132
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,088
This is the stuffed animal.

133
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,092
It's the same one from the attic
where I was locked in.

134
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,971
The photo was sent on April 1.

135
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,973
It was the day
you were saved from kidnapping.

136
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,809
It's also the day
Myung Jin-su made the report call.

137
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,936
But you know what?

138
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,356
If they conspired in this scheme,

139
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,486
was it necessary to bring Myung Jin-su's
son from his grandpa's house?

140
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,156
Right. Especially before
such an important event.

141
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,741
But it would make sense

142
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:07,996
if Myung Jin-su was
also blackmailed, right?

143
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:10,999
Then…

144
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,336
Double kidnapping.

145
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,979
Where's Gu-ho?

146
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,482
He's downstairs, so don't worry.

147
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,776
Where's the money?

148
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,699
It's here, right here.

149
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,535
Are you sure he's okay?

150
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,875
He's over there.

151
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:54,876
What?

152
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,676
Where is he…

153
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,723
The man who kidnapped me also kidnapped
Myung Jin-su's son and threatened him

154
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,308
in order to take the reward for himself.

155
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,726
And he ended the case neatly

156
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,979
by making it look like
he tripped and died.

157
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,983
Myung Jin-su only did what the culprit
told him to do to save his son, Gu-ho.

158
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,902
In the end, he got killed by that jerk.

159
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,070
Gu-ho.

160
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,699
Gu-ho.

161
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,453
I…

162
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,374
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,795
Gu-ho was kidnapped just like you.

164
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,258
Myung Jin-su had no other choice
in order to save Gu-ho.

165
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,736
Oh, poor him.

166
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,308
Call me when you're in Seoul.

167
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,476
Will do.

168
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,145
By the way,
did I make any mistakes last night?

169
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,481
I drank so much I don't remember…

170
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,566
No, it was only more fun that way.

171
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,109
I'm glad to hear that.

172
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,571
Thank you for being my last guests.

173
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,823
-See you.
-Yes.

174
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,996
Right.

175
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,457
He's better off without knowing the truth.

176
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,543
It won't be too late even if we tell him
after we find out who it is.

177
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,920
"James."

178
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,129
James.

179
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,131
Take care!

180
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,521
Voice phishing?

181
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,647
Employment fraud?

182
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,609
Come in.

183
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,582
HAHA JUNGHO

184
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,628
For fresh seafood, Haha Jungho

185
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:48,216
Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution

186
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,427
For sushi, Haha Jungho

187
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,721
For a get-together, Haha Jungho

188
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,975
Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution

189
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,478
For seafood, Haha Jungho!

190
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,483
-Hey, Yi-rang. Is that our new target?
-Yes.

191
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,571
Ha Jung-ho's parents ran
a small raw fish restaurant by the sea.

192
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:15,618
At first, they began by selling 48 tons
of anchovies for bait as edible anchovies.

193
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,787
Then they jumped
into the seafood business.

194
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,206
By bidding and fixing the prices,
they won the business license.

195
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,878
Based on that, they became big figures
in the domestic seafood business.

196
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,089
Ha Jung-ho inherited the business
from his parents.

197
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,634
He's currently in charge of 32.9%
of seafood distribution in the country.

198
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,428
Wow, he's rich.

199
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,471
That's not all.

200
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,349
You know Haha Jungho Sushi
that's popular among Gen Z

201
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,978
and Ha Jung-ho Raw Fish Restaurant,
which older generations go to?

202
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,646
They all belong to him,

203
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,316
which means he's the CEO
of the latest trendy franchises.

204
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,986
Wait. But even after hearing all this,
it doesn't sound like he did anything bad.

205
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,281
I mean, you can't blame the kid
for what his parents did.

206
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,699
You know the saying that goes…

207
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,160
-Two peas in a pod!
-Not that one.

208
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,828
Blood is thicker than water?

209
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,705
I knew it.

210
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,166
It's only normal for him
to have a bigger flaw.

211
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:08,254
That's right. Ha Jung-ho inherited
the scammer's DNA from his parents.

212
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:13,009
He doesn't just relabel imported
or farmed products as domestic and wild.

213
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,388
Remember oilfish, the one banned
from consumption since 2012?

214
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:21,559
He's been raking in huge profits
by mixing that into tuna belly

215
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,520
and grilled toothfish.

216
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,481
Yi-rang, I have to say you're amazing.

217
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,400
How do you find such a piece of garbage
every time?

218
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,361
Well…

219
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,989
Remember I went to watch a movie
the other day?

220
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:39,494
I saw a drunk man
who was ripping paper into pieces

221
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:43,122
and throwing it into a trash can.

222
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,083
And?

223
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,418
I was so curious about what was going on.

224
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,505
Why were you curious?

225
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,923
Of course you get curious.

226
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,175
Hey, it could've been a love letter

227
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,470
or a chain letter from England, you know?

228
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,555
So, what was it?

229
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,350
A will.

230
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,019
What? A will?

231
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,950
Where do you think he put that painting?

232
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,537
It's clearly not in his office.

233
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,373
Mr. Ray-Bang released his boys
to search every corner.

234
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,753
There must be a secret space.
Where could that be?

235
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,512
We need that painting
to lure the culprit according to our plan.

236
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,763
I know.

237
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,557
Mr. Ha.

238
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,059
I'm begging you.

239
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,063
Mr. Oh.

240
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,025
You're putting me in a tough spot.

241
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,111
Mr. Ha.

242
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,907
-No one knows me better than you do.
-Right.

243
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,867
Can you give me one more chance?

244
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,036
I'll make sure this never happens again--

245
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,998
I mean, how can I ignore that incident

246
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,459
when the news spread all over the country?

247
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,044
Get up now.

248
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:16,174
Then can you take over my factory?

249
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,512
Can you at least help my employees?
I'm begging you.

250
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,514
Leave first.

251
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,683
For goodness' sake, leave for now.

252
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,818
He must be in shock. He looks unstable.

253
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,072
Is that how he looks to you too?

254
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,532
Something doesn't feel right.

255
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,909
Should we follow him?

256
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,369
Should we?

257
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,085
YOUR MOVIE

258
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,587
WHERE YOU ARE THE LEAD

259
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,844
A WONDERFUL HAPPY ENDING

260
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,513
IS WAITING FOR YOU

261
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,764
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

262
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,248
I'm glad he's just leaving.

263
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,002
Anyway, who thought of installing
those phrases there?

264
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,546
Whoever it was
deserves the Nobel Prize… Hey.

265
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,922
Where are you going?

266
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,007
Wait, hey…

267
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,263
What's she doing?

268
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,933
Why's she picking that up?

269
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,479
Did you tape it all together?

270
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,564
So, this is the will you mentioned?

271
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,565
Yes.

272
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,192
Remember how an entire elementary school

273
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,943
was sent to the hospital recently
after lunch?

274
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,028
Yes.

275
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,489
Does Ha Jung-ho have anything
to do with that?

276
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,785
With politicians on his back,

277
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:54,540
he skillfully manipulated the media
and put the blame on his subcontractors.

278
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:59,045
So, without any restrictions or penalties,
he was able to escape,

279
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,548
and only the innocent factory owners
had to shut down their factories.

280
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,134
That's insane…

281
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,469
Wait.

282
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,430
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

283
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,431
Wait…

284
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,016
Oilfish.

285
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,392
-Hey. Wait.
-What the…

286
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,602
It's coming out. Let me go.

287
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,480
Have you been working out? Your muscles…

288
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,655
CEO HA JUNG-HO
DEPOSITED 30,000,000 WON

289
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,534
Why did you send so much?

290
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,120
I thought you'd need some money
to make ends meet for now.

291
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,793
I'll never forget your kindness.

292
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,087
Cheer up.

293
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,929
I'm sorry.

294
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,514
Don't say that.

295
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,724
You've been working so hard until now.

296
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,852
You did your best, sir.

297
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,397
There must be jobs for us in this country.

298
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,402
This makes me so sad.

299
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,363
Sir, cheer up.

300
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,281
Sir.

301
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,535
How can someone so old be that naive?

302
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,246
He is downright pathetic.

303
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,008
Secretary Choi,
Mr. Oh's factory will be on auction soon.

304
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,509
Take that over immediately,

305
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,763
and place all the factory items
we purchased back where they were.

306
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,106
Why would I pay in full
to take over a factory

307
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,692
with old and intractable employees?

308
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,242
So, how do you plan to teach
that oilfish man a lesson?

309
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,327
-That's…
-Hold on.

310
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,998
Gosh, this oilfish is serious.

311
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,458
Toilet paper!

312
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,253
Are you going again?

313
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,215
Gosh, it's serious.

314
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,973
I have this operation planned out.

315
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,684
Gu-ho, you'll become a mailman

316
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,229
and switch Ha Jung-ho's movie magazine
to the one that we made.

317
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,941
Ha Jung-ho is a serious movie fanatic.

318
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,403
He's so extreme
that he watches every new movie.

319
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,159
Well, thanks to his con parents,
Ha Jung-ho was born rich.

320
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,370
So, in college,
he dreamed of becoming an actor

321
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:41,791
by directing and starring
in the movie he wrote.

322
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,378
He was into Hong Kong gangster movies
at the time,

323
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,463
so he wrote
about a young and handsome gangster

324
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:52,468
who wanted to change the world
back in the '60s.

325
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,638
-Boss!
-Boss!

326
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,354
Look here, thug!

327
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,402
How about a one-on-one fight with me?

328
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,697
Everyone who watched it
said it was childish,

329
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,116
but Ha Jung-ho was serious.

330
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,243
Although no one recognized it,

331
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,746
it was like a suppressed message
from deep within his heart.

332
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,043
Perhaps his obsession with cinema
was his only escape.

333
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,671
Was that movie even released?

334
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,423
I've never seen that before.

335
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,174
There was no way it was released.

336
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,968
It was just for his own use.

337
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,097
He lived his life just as a business heir.

338
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,182
But he was in the spotlight

339
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,394
when he was pouring his passion
onto the screen.

340
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,523
Oh, so handsome.

341
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,360
Jeez, I don't even need to see it.

342
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:54,071
I bet it wasn't even B-list
but a lame piece of garbage.

343
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:57,283
It's obvious
since he has the scammer's DNA in him.

344
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,703
It was probably a ridiculous story
plagiarized from here and there.

345
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,705
You got it.

346
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,875
He probably didn't know
that it would be his last movie either.

347
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,043
Boss!

348
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,713
-Boss.
-Go help him!

349
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,173
Boss, are you okay?

350
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,841
Let me go. Don't touch me.

351
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,427
Justice prevails.

352
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,770
When he wanted to go study film in the US,

353
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,564
due to his father's
unexpected health issues,

354
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,274
he had to take over the family business.

355
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:35,988
Cinema is an unfulfilled dream
for Ha Jung-ho.

356
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,868
"Weekly Cinema."

357
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,918
"If Paris, France, has Les Deux Magots,

358
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,212
in Chungmuro, Korea,

359
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,216
there's the Café Soran-Soran
that filmmakers love."

360
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,134
Café Soran-Soran?

361
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,637
I've never heard of it before.

362
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,686
FISHERIES DISTRIBUTION
CEO HA JUNG-HO

363
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,737
Gosh, this is boring.

364
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,120
"If Paris, France, has Les Deux Magots,

365
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,288

there's the Café Soran-Soran
that filmmakers love."

367
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,177
CAFÉ SORAN-SORAN

368
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,599
CAFÉ SORAN-SORAN

369
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,269
THE OPERATION BEGINS

370
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,859
Thirty seconds before arriving.

371
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,498
He's going down now.

372
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,293
Director Kang, are you ready?

373
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,210
Yes.

374
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:14,837
Good luck.

375
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,505
-Thanks for your cooperation.
-Five.

376
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,719
Four, three, two, one.

377
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,929
Madam Kim, that was good.

378
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,056
Thank you. Bye, Director Kang.

379
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,980
Director Kang, how are you?

380
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,232
-Hey, Kang-min.
-Hello, Director Kang.

381
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,485
-Let's talk outside.
-Are you working on a movie?

382
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm doing my best.

383
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,571
Hello.

384
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,450
Was that Director Kang Yun-sung
of The Outlaws and Big Bet?

385
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,869
That is Director Kang.

386
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,706
Is this your first time at our cafe?

387
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,751
Yes. I read about it in the magazine.

388
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,086
Oh, that magazine!

389
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,757
Hold on. What should I drink?

390
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,050
Well…

391
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,803
How about Director Kang's usual?

392
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,306
The Director Kang who just left?

393
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,849
Yes! I'll have that.

394
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,229
-One moment, please.
-Hey, Hwa-ryeon. We're here.

395
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,147
Hi, you're late.

396
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,858
-There was a problem on set.
-I see.

397
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,693
-The usual.
-Sure.

398
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,695
-Make that two.
-Okay.

399
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,697
Make that two.

400
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,824
-Director Kim.
-Yes.

401
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,868
I want to compress this scene.

402
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,956
But Mr. Lee, the climax
will be too boring without this scene.

403
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,749
Why are you so extreme?

404
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,961
I'm not saying we should get rid of it
but just keep it simple.

405
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,171
Is it about the budget again?

406
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,548
You know we have no other choice.

407
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,218
We should make concessions
considering the situation.

408
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,096
I'll think about it.

409
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,807
Yes. Thank you.
But we can keep this part in return.

410
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,100
Excuse me.

411
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,270
Do you know
Dragon King Production by any chance?

412
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,479
Yes.

413
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,984
He's the CEO,
and that is a rookie director.

414
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,322
But things aren't looking pretty lately.

415
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,534
What about the cast?

416
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,829
It's a female-led movie,
so Kim Da-eun will do it for sure.

417
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,206
But Hyeon-u is the problem.

418
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,793
He thinks he was born a celeb.
That brat is being so arrogant.

419
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,253
Forget about Hyeon-u.

420
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:23,132
If Kim Da-eun said she'd do it,
any actor would be willing to do it.

421
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:24,967
No need to worry about that, but…

422
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,552
But? What else is the problem?

423
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:32,349
The role of the thug
who devotes his life to the female lead.

424
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,145
Oh, you mean the short but intense role.

425
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,439
-That's a good one. You know it.
-Yes. It's awesome.

426
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,690
A thug?

427
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,068
Is it a gangster movie?

428
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,530
He doesn't have to be good at acting,
but I want it to be someone with the look.

429
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,449
Oh, that's possible.

430
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,160
We can reduce the lines
and focus on the look.

431
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,286
Don't worry about that.

432
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,872
Just name it. I'll bring him to you now.

433
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,916
In a way, that role is my persona.

434
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,668
Okay. Don't worry.

435
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,795
What about Nam Gi-hun from Macho Man?

436
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,964
A thug who sacrifices his life.

437
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,885
The director's persona? Wow.

438
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,803
Thanks for the drink.

439
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,430
Hey, Hwa-ryeon. We're leaving.

440
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,768
James, this target looks too easy.

441
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,187
I know. This will totally end in no time.

442
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,772
How about chicken feet with soju?

443
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,482
Hagfish with somaek on top of that?

444
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,733
-You got me.
-Yeah.

445
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,613
-Did you leave the script behind?
-Of course.

446
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,530
Okay.

447
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,689
MADAM GANGSTER
CONFIDENTIAL

448
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,778
"In 1962, gangs ran wild
around Jongno and Euljiro."

449
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:13,283
"But there was one woman who could
take them all down with her bare fists."

450
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,161
"They called her Madam Gangster."

451
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,040
It was about a heroine?

452
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,542
Impressive.

453
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,419
It's probably here. Don't worry.

454
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,003
Man, seriously.

455
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,839
You saw it earlier.

456
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,758
It should be here…

457
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,219
You should've taken care of it!
What if someone reads it?

458
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,847
We talked while looking at the script.

459
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,016
Mr. Lee, if anyone plagiarizes it,
I won't let that slide.

460
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,310
Then we'll totally sue them!

461
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,105
-We'll sue them.
-Plagiarize? Sue?

462
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:45,399
Excuse me.

463
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,693
What?

464
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,660
It was on the ground, so I picked it up.

465
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,246
Thank you so much.

466
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,331
Gosh, that was close.

467
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,249
Excuse me.

468
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,627
By any chance, did you read it?

469
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:07,963
No. Why would I read it?

470
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,214
Can I take your word for it?

471
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,508
Come on. I'm sure he didn't.
It's not even his.

472
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,762
-Unless he's gone crazy.
-Only a little bit of the beginning.

473
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:16,847
Did you read it?

474
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,724
I only read the beginning slightly.

475
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,559
He read it!

476
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,019
I'm sorry. My bad.

477
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,564
If you read it, you read it.
What do you mean by "slightly"?

478
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,191
You… Wait.

479
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,943
-We've met before.
-What?

480
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,195
You look familiar.

481
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,529
What?

482
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:37,326
-Are you from the film industry?
-No, I'm not from that industry.

483
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,911
-Then?
-Right. Here.

484
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,413
My name is Ha Jung-ho.

485
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,290
Ha Jung-woo?

486
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,626
You look nothing like him.
How dare you impersonate an actor?

487
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,710
No, it's Ha Jung-ho.

488
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,504
"Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution?"

489
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,089
I remember where I've seen you!

490
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,176
It's the commercial
where you dance with fish?

491
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,471
-That Ha Jung-ho!
-CEO Ha Jung-ho.

492
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,056
Have you seen it?

493
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:03,977
Due to my love for movies,
I made a mistake.

494
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,730
Oh, you should've told me.

495
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:10,484
-I'm CEO Lee Seok-jin of Dragon King.
-The CEO.

496
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,860
And this is a rookie director.

497
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,946
Hi, I'm Director Kim Hong-pyo.

498
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,366
-Director Kim Hong-pyo.
-Yes.

499
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,408
Have a seat first.

500
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,910
-Oh, sure.
-This way.

501
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,621
-Have a seat, please.
-Thanks.

502
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,706
-It's an honor.
-Nice to meet you.

503
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,335
I didn't know you loved movies.

504
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,378
Same.

505
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,464
I'm ashamed to say this,

506
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,885
but I learned about life from movies.

507
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,179
Oh, you love it that much?

508
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,432
People from different times and places

509
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:47,938
can share emotions
by watching the same movie.

510
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,439
Isn't the power of movies amazing?

511
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,276
Movies are fiction,

512
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,655
but the emotions of viewers are real.

513
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,284
Gosh. That's what you're making.

514
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,663
You two are truly amazing.

515
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,664
That's philosophical.

516
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,374
That's how serious he is about movies.

517
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,375
I know.

518
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,503
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes.

519
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,131
Do you want to finish reading it?

520
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,885
-Me?
-Yes.

521
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,637
It's something
no one outside the production can read,

522
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,682
but you could be part of it in the future.

523
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,475
So, why don't you give it a read?

524
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,768
"Part of it?"

525
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,063
Since you're a movie lover…

526
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:33,525
Are you interested
in investing in our movie?

527
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,448
Well…

528
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,908
After reading it.

529
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,452
Of course.
Please take your time to read it.

530
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,621
Can we have three coffees here?

531
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,164
-Okay, three coffees.
-No.

532
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,877
Get us the most expensive liquor
in this place.

533
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,794
My goodness.

534
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,266
This is good.

535
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,101
Once-in-a-decade…

536
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:12,564
No, this is
a once-in-50-years masterpiece!

537
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,902
Director Kim here knows
how to write good scripts.

538
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,278
Oh, I'm flattered.

539
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,785
The lead lost her parents before her eyes.

540
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:25,953
A FEW WEEKS AGO

541
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,080
Due to the shock, she lost her memories.

542
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:33,877
One day, she sees the tattoo
on a man passing by,

543
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,714
and all the memories she'd forgotten
suddenly come back to her.

544
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,675
The tattoo in her memory

545
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,637
is the symbol of the West Gate Gang.

546
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,060
She then begins destroying the
West Gate Gang's businesses one by one.

547
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,395
Then finally,

548
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:57,359
she finds a man who's deeply related
to the death of her parents.

549
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,527
Here's the twist.

550
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:03,407
Her parents weren't actually her parents.

551
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,161
And the enemy of her parents

552
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,247
was actually her stepbrother.

553
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,374
An older stepbrother.

554
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,210
Gosh, it couldn't get any worse.

555
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,753
You know what?

556
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:21,508
No movie ever went bad
with memory loss and birth secret trope.

557
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,387
Still, don't you think
that's too outdated?

558
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,139
-You think so?
-Yes.

559
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,725
1972
ALL ABOUT SCENARIO WRITING

560
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,102
Oh, this was from 1972!

561
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,938
Right? I knew it.

562
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,190
-That won't do it.
-The latest version.

563
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,943
There it is. This is the latest edition.

564
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,863
-Hey, delete all that.
-Yes. Delete everything.

565
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,656
We can't use that.

566
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,035
We'll start from Scene One.

567
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,579
-Okay. Scene One.
-Scene One.

568
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,497
Here's the evidence.

569
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,958
Our production cost is 20 billion won.

570
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,753
And we gathered 16 billion won in no time.

571
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,129
TOTAL INVESTMENT AMOUNT

572
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,338
16 BILLION WON

573
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,508
Now, we're left
with only four billion won.

574
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,260
Now, what do you say?

575
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,847
Would you like to start
your first movie with us?

576
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,474
It's only four billion won.

577
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,018
Mr. Ha.

578
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,313
If someone like you who truly loves movies
invests in us,

579
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,191
I will feel huge support.

580
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:20,859
Would you like to invest?

581
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,871
A movie like this
is exactly what we need in this era.

582
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,081
That's right.

583
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,707
-Yes.
-That's right.

584
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,709
Invest…

585
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,752
-Invest.
-Invest.

586
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,711
Invest…

587
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,755
Invest!

588
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,343
How can I?

589
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,761
That's nonsense.

590
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,054
Here. Cheers.

591
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,810
So,

592
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:59,314
your father was also a director?

593
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,524
Yes, that's right.

594
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,443
Well, perhaps it's because of his father,

595
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:08,782
but the whole film industry
is expecting a lot from him, you know?

596
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,242
I see.

597
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,621
Me too. I took over the family business.

598
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:18,750
I think I kind of understand how you feel.

599
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,420
That's right.
And you're a second-generation chaebol.

600
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:23,421
A chaebol.

601
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,215
And I'm a second-generation director.

602
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,176
We're both second-generations.
We have so much in common.

603
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,761
That's what I mean.

604
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:30,971
Maybe we're meant to be.

605
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,808
We're aiming for our movie
to reach ten million viewers.

606
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,979
-Ten million.
-Ten million.

607
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,690
Let's make a movie
with ten million viewers together, Mr. Ha!

608
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,608
Let's do that! Ten million!

609
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,693
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

610
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,777
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

611
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:46,862
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

612
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,738
-Ten million!
-No way.

613
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,160
An amateur like me?

614
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,413
Come on.
I don't want to cause you trouble.

615
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,497
Come on.

616
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,833
-Stop joking. Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

617
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,335
Come on. Ten million sounds impossible.

618
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,758
Hey, listen.

619
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,056
-Rather than those investors…
-Yes.

620
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,310
-The ones who are only after money…
-Yes.

621
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:24,024
I want a sincere cinema lover like you

622
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:28,695
to invest in our movie
and make a big profit.

623
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,615
-So please!
-Yes!

624
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,075
-Let's make a movie together, Mr. Ha!
-Let's do it!

625
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,994
This is worth money.

626
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:36,995
Yes.

627
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,330
I'm begging you. Please!

628
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,748
-Please!
-Please!

629
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,045
-Please!
-Please!

630
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,171
No.

631
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,089
Darn it.

632
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,007
Never!

633
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,053
If I invest now…

634
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,262
Come on.

635
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,597
Think about it. Okay?

636
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,309
If I invest in your movie now…
I'm not even from this industry.

637
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,603
It doesn't make any sense. Jeez.

638
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:09,319
You know, I take back
what I said about an easy target.

639
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,489
He looks like he'd fall for it,
but he won't. Damn it.

640
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,908
Why is he refusing to invest?

641
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,910
-It's a hassle to curl my hair.
-I'm dying.

642
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,995
He's a pain in the neck.

643
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:20,872
I…

644
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,334
understand him.

645
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,127
When did you two get here?

646
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,964
I called him.
Mr. Mustache used to work in film.

647
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:30,715
What's up?

648
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,052
So? What's his deal?

649
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:41,935
It's not easy to approach
someone you've respected for so long.

650
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,145
What's that?

651
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,231
It's like this.

652
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,447
The campus queen
you didn't even dare to look at

653
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,950
suddenly asks you out.

654
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,995
Then you should be grateful
and go out with her.

655
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,454
No can do.

656
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,164
-What do you mean?
-What?

657
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,666
So, basically,

658
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:09,421
she's like a noble being from heaven
you can't even touch.

659
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,923
So you don't dare to approach her.

660
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,591
Still, that sounds like a loser.

661
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,927
A loser?
How can you say something so mean?

662
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,684
That reminds me…

663
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,604
If someone like you who truly loves movies
invests in us,

664
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,398
I will feel huge support.

665
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,649
Would you like to invest?

666
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,736
How can I? That's nonsense.

667
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,572
Let's make a movie
with ten million viewers together, Mr. Ha!

668
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,490
Let's do that! Ten million!

669
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,700
No way.

670
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,786
I want a sincere cinema lover like you
to invest…

671
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,912
No.

672
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,164
Darn it.

673
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:45,832
Never!

674
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,210
I think I get it now.

675
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,380
A spoiled brat who has always gotten
everything he's wanted in his whole life

676
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:54,799
becomes naive and timid

677
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,926
before the cinema,

678
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,054
which he has always admired.

679
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,473
So?

680
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,102
Do you now understand a true film lover?

681
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,481
No, I don't get it.

682
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:13,276
But if he's startled
by something unexpected,

683
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,780
then I plan to have
a little fling with him.

684
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,615
Then he'll find himself

685
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,202
signing the contract
even before he knows it.

686
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,500
Mr. Ha.

687
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,044
You should come
and watch our first shoot today.

688
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,421
Are you sure it's a place for me?

689
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:36,132
Come on. You're hurting my feelings now.

690
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:39,302
You're part of our production, almost.

691
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,351
-This is where we're filming.
-I see.

692
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,395
Hello, sir.

693
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,771
Hi, keep up the good work.

694
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,814
How are you?

695
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,273
-This way.
-Thanks.

696
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,402
Another production
is filming on that side.

697
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,319
This way.

698
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,658
It's a huge set.

699
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,745
People on each side and…

700
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,789
Okay, we'll start.

701
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,104
Cut. We'll give it a look.

702
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,233
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

703
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,693
-Loyalty.
-Loyalty.

704
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,321
You haven't changed. How's your back?

705
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,781
My back has gotten better.

706
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:42,866
That's a relief.

707
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,202
You look great, by the way.

708
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,496
Oh, thank you. I aged a lot.

709
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:51,082
I heard the new script was good.

710
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,834
-Really?
-You should show me.

711
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,794
Sure. He's the producer of my movie.

712
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,297
I'm not a producer yet.

713
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,257
-I'm Ha Jung-ho.
-Hello.

714
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,550
I'm a big fan of yours!

715
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,178
Why, thank you.

716
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,929
-Sir, let's check the playback.
-Okay.

717
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,639
-I'll keep you updated.
-Okay.

718
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:07,599
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

719
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,683
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

720
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,561
-Kim Bo-sung?
-Yes. You know, "Loyalty!"

721
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,479
Yes, I know.

722
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:13,438
-The action star.
-Yes.

723
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,064
I'm a huge fan.

724
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,942
-We have to go this way.
-This way?

725
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:21,946
Hello.

726
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,616
Director Kim!

727
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,203
-Mr. Ha!
-Hi.

728
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,079
Director Kim.

729
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:31,164
You're working hard.

730
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,124
Thank you for coming all the way here.

731
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,751
Everyone, say hi.

732
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,670
Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution's CEO,
Ha Jung-ho.

733
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,339
-Hello.
-Hello.

734
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,590
Oh, hello.

735
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:44,636
Mr. Ha sent a fishcake truck
for our hardworking staff.

736
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,387
Give it up for him!

737
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,014
Fishcake truck!

738
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,225
-Thank you!
-Thank you, Mr. Ha.

739
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,601
-No problem.
-This way, please.

740
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,519
Okay.

741
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,395
Mr. Ha, take a seat here.

742
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,313
DIRECTOR

743
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,440
Oh, how can I…

744
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:59,192
Come on. We're not strangers, you know?

745
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,443
Have a seat. It's okay.

746
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,237
Should I, then?

747
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,702
-Mr. Ha, take your time to look around.
-Sure.

748
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,997
-This is Camera A, and that's Camera B.
-I see.

749
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,541
-At the end…
-We use two cameras.

750
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,543
When the door opens,
the female lead comes out.

751
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,878
And the sun shines over her. Okay.

752
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,756
-Are the cameras ready?
-Yes, they're ready.

753
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,675
-Are the lights ready?
-Yes.

754
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,385
Then we'll begin now.

755
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,222
Here we go.

756
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,057
One, two…

757
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:35,353
One, two, three.

758
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,667
Oh no. What the…

759
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,753
What the heck?

760
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:01,671
What happened?

761
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,089
-Oh no.
-What's going on?

762
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,674
Is that part of the script?

763
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,509
No, I don't think so.

764
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:07,760
Gosh, this is bad.

765
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,761
We have a patient!

766
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,305
-What happened?
-Call an ambulance!

767
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,347
Ambulance!

768
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,266
Is she okay?

769
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,893
What? I don't know.

770
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:18,646
Eat up. It's okay.

771
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,981
Yes, enjoy.

772
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,233
-Thanks for the food.
-Thank you.

773
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,110
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

774
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,111
Thank you.

775
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,113
Let's eat before the fishcakes get soggy.

776
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:31,034
By the way, how's the female lead doing?

777
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,661
Darn it.

778
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,830
Why? What's wrong?

779
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,166
I just got a call
from Kim Da-eun's manager.

780
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,167
She's quitting.

781
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,501
She's quitting?

782
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,171
How come? Is it a health issue?

783
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,092
-Anemia from pregnancy.
-My goodness.

784
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,385
Damn it.

785
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,095
This is bad.

786
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,099
All the companies that invested
because of her will want their money back.

787
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,310
Tell them to take it.

788
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:00,021
I don't want money
from companies with crappy attitudes.

789
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,232
But how are you going to film
without that money?

790
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,233
I don't even know.

791
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,860
Okay, well…

792
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,779
We can't postpone it anymore.

793
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,947
Let's reduce the scale.

794
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,532
Reduce the scale?

795
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,702
Are you telling me
to make a rubbish movie then?

796
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,037
No, that's impossible.

797
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,164
How do you know
if it'll be rubbish or a masterpiece

798
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,708
-before you try--
-Of course I do! Isn't it obvious?

799
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,418
Then what are you going to do
without money?

800
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:26,214
For goodness' sake!
It's always about money!

801
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,716
Is that all you care about?
I'm freaking sick of it!

802
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,885
What? Sick of money?

803
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,098
How are you going to make the movie
without money? What a clueless dude.

804
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,517
Watch how you speak to the director!

805
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,435
What did I say wrong?

806
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,521
Do you want me to call him a jerk then?

807
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,315
-Calm down.
-What a nut.

808
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,858
-Hey!
-Calm down.

809
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,485
Come on. Please calm down!

810
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:48,403
That freaking…

811
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,197
The script is good.
You'll get more investors soon.

812
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,740
What are you saying?

813
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,576
Who's going to invest in a movie
without a female lead?

814
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,079
-Would you do that?
-That's what I mean.

815
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,248
Would you invest in it? Would you?

816
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,999
Would you invest in the movie?

817
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,459
Would you take that risk?

818
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,795
-Would you do it then?
-Answer me.

819
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,505
-Would you do it yourself?
-Would you?

820
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,799
All right. Fine.

821
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,468
Well, how much do you need?

822
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,512
How many times did I tell you?
Just four billion won!

823
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,098
It's just four billion!
Wouldn't you want to invest?

824
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,183
Will you do it? It's only four billion!

825
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,018
Answer us already! Would you invest?

826
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,938
-Would you?
-It's only four billion!

827
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,899
-I…
-What?

828
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,285
How can I invest? That's ridiculous.

829
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,662
I give up! I'm not doing this!

830
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,039
Hey, let's wrap up!

831
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,500
Hey, clean it up! Take the equipment!

832
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:45,585
What?

833
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,337
Wait, what's going on?

834
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,258
Seriously, why is he hesitating so much?

835
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,595
He looks like he almost fell for it,
but he just won't do it.

836
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,013
It's driving me insane.

837
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,931
Exactly.

838
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:02,560
Still, casting that major actor
was a good strategy.

839
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,189
Thank you so much for your help, sir.
I know you're busy.

840
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,567
No matter how busy I am,
if it were for you, I'd do it.

841
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,320
I knew you were loyal.

842
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,237
Oh, right.

843
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,073
It's not much, but please accept it.

844
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:26,292
It wasn't even that difficult.
Why so much?

845
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,796
What do you mean?
It's far from your name value.

846
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,424
Well, if you need me again,
don't hesitate to call me.

847
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:34,634
I'm free these days.

848
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,094
I don't dare to bother
a great actor like you.

849
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,638
Once is enough for me.

850
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,806
No.

851
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,099
I'm not busy at all. Make sure to call me.

852
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,852
Oh, no, sir. Thank you for saying that.

853
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm busy. I should get going.

854
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,855
-Mr. Mustache.
-Yes?

855
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:49,857
Call me.

856
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,109
I've been struggling lately.

857
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:57,031
I don't even need a line.
I could be a passerby in the back, okay?

858
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,783
You know me. Loyalty!

859
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,076
Loyalty!

860
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,661
I'll see you later, sir.

861
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,497
He's done his job. Seriously, I'm busy.

862
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,920
That man's really loyal.

863
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:14,215
When a junior asked, he didn't
even look at the script or check the pay.

864
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,092
He said okay right away.

865
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:21,973
But what's the point? Our target
ripped off his trap and left cheerfully.

866
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,808
Come on. You know there's a saying.

867
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,102
"You get stabbed
by the axe that you trust."

868
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,937
What about that proverb?

869
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,065
If it didn't work at once,
you can try it two, three, four times.

870
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,693
You're clueless.

871
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:37,196
That's not the proverb you want to say.
It's "Every tree falls after ten chops."

872
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,948
Well, it's all the same.

873
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,867
How can the two be the same?

874
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,288
Yi-rang, you're not thinking about
playing the badger game, are you?

875
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,873
Wait. No.

876
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,166
-No, please say you're not.
-I'm pretty.

877
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,252
I'm so pretty. Hello, everyone.

878
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:56,716
Listen. Ha Jung-ho got divorced twice.

879
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,636
-So? Do you think I could seduce him?
-No, don't take advantage of him.

880
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,722
-Don't do anything.
-Should I make it shorter?

881
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,223
-I don't want to see that.
-Don't.

882
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,642
-Like this. Here.
-Don't. Hey!

883
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:07,643
No.

884
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,228
Nice. Very good.

885
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:10,438
No, don't do it.

886
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,273
-Nice.
-No, stop it.

887
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,150
-No. Stop it.
-All right.

888
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,652
Do I look good?

889
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,195
Don't do that. That's wrong.

890
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,197
Not the badger game, no.

891
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:21,949
-Please stop.
-This is wrong.

892
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:32,168
THE GODDESS OF THE MAINLAND
ACTOR MARY YOO

893
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,669
Mary Yoo?

894
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,296
I've never heard of that name before.

895
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,257
"Mary Yoo
is not that well-known in Korea."

896
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,551
"Influenced by her father
of Hong Kong nationality,

897
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:43,387
she first debuted in China
and became a Chinese goddess."

898
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:47,099
"She's currently looking for her first…"

899
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,563
"She's looking for her first movie?"

900
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,030
Oh, it's him.

901
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,031
It's him.

902
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:05,701
Yes, Mr. Ha.

903
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,161
Director Kim,

904
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,539
have you decided on the female lead yet?

905
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,584
Not yet.
I'm busy because of that right now.

906
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,712
Really? Then for the female lead--

907
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,005
Sorry, I'll call you back.

908
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:18,965
Hello?

909
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:20,800
Hello?

910
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:31,185
FROM THE GODDESS OF MAINLAND
TO A STAR IN KOREA!

911
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,698
Fine. Then we'll play the game you want.

912
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:45,866
What do you want to play?

913
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,208
It's too cruel to call it a game.

914
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:58,337
Because the utopia that you dream of…

915
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,344
I'll turn that into complete hell.

916
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:46,218
She was different
from the moment I first saw her.

917
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:50,306
A baby who just took his first step
into the film industry is excited.

918
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,224
Bravo! That's impressive!

919
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,517
We should play along.

920
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,894
Here we go.

921
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,103
Action!

922
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,938
Where did he put that painting?

923
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,441
There was nothing unusual
in Ha Jung-ho's movement.

924
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,277
Like the night of a full moon?

925
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:05,613
There's something between the two.

926
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,031
A painting like that…

927
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:12,286
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.
